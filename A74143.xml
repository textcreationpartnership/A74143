            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas it hath been found by experience, that notwithſtanding the ſtrict and ſevere Laws made and ſtanding in force againſt Ieſuits and Popiſh Prieſts, many of them have preſumed to reſort into, and remain within this Commonwealth, and the Dominions thereunto belonging, and do with great audacity exerciſe all Offices of their profeſſion, both ſaying Maſſes, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the People to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by conſequence ſeducing them from the true perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which all people ought to have of their duty and obedience to their Governours, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Our Self obliged in duty and conſcience to uſe all good means to preſerve the people from being corrupted in Religion, Piety and Obedience, to keep them from being infected with Superſtitious and Idolatrous opinions in matters of Religion, which cannot be ſo ſurely performed as by keeping them from the Miniſters and Inſtruments of that infection, which are the Prieſts of all ſorts, Ordained in foreign Parts, by Authority prohibited by the Laws of this Land, concerning whom therefore, We have thought it fit to publiſh this open Declaration of Our purpoſe and intentions, that careful and diligent ſearch be made by all Our Officers and Miniſters, and by all others to whom it may appertain, for all Ieſuits, Popiſh Prieſts and others, having taken Orders by authority derived or pretended to be deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that whereſoever, and whenſoever they ſhall be found, they be apprehended and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Common-Goal of that County where they ſhall be found, there to remain without Bayl or Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, untill by due Courſe of Law they ſhall be tryed and proceeded againſt. And we do hereby give notice to all whom it may concern at their uttermoſt perills that the Harbourers, Receivers and Maintainers of Ieſuits, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts, and all ſuch others as have received or ſhall receive Orders, as aforeſaid, ſhall be left to the due and ordinary Courſe of Law. And We do expect and command, That all Our Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, and all other Officers and Miniſters whatſoever, do put in full and effectual execution the ſeveral Laws, Statutes and Ordinances now in force againſt all and ſingular the perſons aforementioned or intended.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as of late time there hath been a great neglect in putting the Laws in execution for convicting of Popiſh Recuſants, by means whereof the penalties impoſed on ſuch perſons cannot be levied nor required, which hath been a great Encouragement to many to be ſeduced and miſled to embrace and entertain the dangerous, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and idolatrous Doctrines of Popery; We, by the Advice of Our Council, having taken into Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the great Importance and Conſequence to the State which ſuch a remiſneſs or connivance may produce, have thought fit to Declare and Command, That the Oath commonly called <hi>The Oath of Abjuration,</hi> and appointed by an Ordinance of the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament to be adminiſtred unto any perſon being of the Age of One and twenty years, ſhall be by ſuch perſons as are therein and thereby Impowered and Authorized to do the ſame, and the Ordinance concerning the ſame be hereafter put in full and effectual execution: And becauſe none may pretend ignorance of what they are to do, or how they ought to demean themſelves, We have thought fit to expreſs the Words of the ſaid Oath, and the Clauſes in the ſaid Ordinance relating thereunto, which are as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> That all ſuch perſons as (being of the Age of Twenty one Years or above) ſhall refuſe to take the Oath hereafter expreſſed, which any two Juſtices of the Peace, or the Major, Bayliff, or other Head-officer of any City or Town Corporate ſhall have power to adminiſter to any ſuch perſon or perſons, ſhall forfeit as Papiſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this and the former Ordinance, and Seizure and Sequeſtration of Two third Parts of all their Goods and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates real and perſonal, and Sale of ſuch Proportion of their Goods ſo ſeized and ſequeſtred ſhall be made, and their Rents and Eſtates diſpoſed of in ſuch maner and proportion, and by ſuch perſons, as by the ſaid Ordinance of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration is appointed for Papiſts: The Oath as followeth;</p>
            <p>
               <q>I <hi>A. B.</hi> do Abjure and Renounce the Pope's Supremacy and Authority over the Catholique Church in general, and over my ſelf in particular; and I do believe that there is not any Tranſubſtantiation in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, or in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bread and Wine after Conſecration thereof by any perſon whatſoever; and I do alſo believe that there is not any Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and that the Conſecrated Hoaſt, Crucifixes or Images ought not to be worſhipped, neither that any worſhip is due unto any of them; and I alſo believe, that Salvation cannot be merited by Works, and all Doctrines in affirmation of the ſaid points I do abjure and renounce, without any Equivocation, Mental Reſervation or ſecret Evaſion whatſoever, taking the words by me ſpoken according to the common and uſual meaning of them: So help me God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And Our further Will and Command is, That the perſons herewith intruſted do take due Care that the Oath before recited be tendred unto all perſons that ſhall be ſuſpected to be Popiſhly affected, and that the Names of ſuch as ſhall refuſe to take the ſaid Oath, or being legally required ſhall neglect to attend accordingly, be certified into Our Court of Exchequer under their Hands and Seals, that ſo Proceedings be had and made againſt them and their Eſtates, according to Law, and to the ſeveral Acts of Parliament and Ordinances made in that behalf.</p>
            <p>And we do again ſtraitly Charge and Command all and ſingular Our Iuſtices of the Peace, Majors, Bayliffs, and all other Our Officers whom it may concern, to miniſter the ſame Oath to all ſuch perſons, and in all ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as by the Law they are enabled, knowing that the meaning of the Law was not onely to Authorize them to do it when they would, and to forbear it at their pleaſure, but to require it at their hands as a neceſſary duty commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, and impoſed on them as perſons of Chief Truſt under Us for the good and ſafety of the People.</p>
